        "\n",
        "1. **Document Loading Quality** (from `1-DocumentLoading.ipynb`)\n",
        "   - Use appropriate loaders (`PyPDFLoader`, `YoutubeAudioLoader`, etc.)\n",
        "   - Preserve metadata for citation and filtering\n",
        "   - Validate text extraction quality\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Vector Store Management**\n",
        "   - Use consistent embedding models across loading and querying\n",
        "   - Monitor collection size and quality\n",
        "   - Implement versioning for document updates\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prompt Engineering**\n",
        "   - Explicitly instruct models to say \"I don't know\" when uncertain\n",
        "   - Set answer length limits to control verbosity\n",
        "   - Include format requirements in the prompt\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Chain Type Selection**\n",
        "   - Start with \"stuff\" (default) for most use cases\n",
        "   - Use \"refine\" for questions requiring comprehensive answers\n",
        "   - Use \"map_reduce\" only when context window is a constraint\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Source Attribution**\n",
        "   - Always return source documents for citation\n",
        "   - Display page numbers and source files to users\n",
        "   - Log which sources influenced each answer (audit trail)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Evaluation and Monitoring**\n",
        "   - Test retrieval quality independently of generation\n",
        "   - Monitor answer accuracy against ground truth\n",
        "   - Track cost (LLM calls) and latency for each chain type\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Pitfalls\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Mismatched embedding models**: Using different models for indexing vs. querying  \n",
        "✅ **Solution**: Store embedding model version in vector store metadata\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Lost metadata**: Chunking documents without preserving source information  \n",
        "✅ **Solution**: Use proper document loaders that maintain metadata inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Over-retrieval**: Fetching too many chunks exceeds context window  \n",
        "✅ **Solution**: Tune `k` parameter, use smaller chunks, or switch to map_reduce\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ **Hallucination**: LLM makes up answers not in retrieved context  \n",
        "✅ **Solution**: Add \"say I don't know\" instructions to prompt, use temperature=0\n",

        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "The complete RAG pipeline demonstrated here can be extended with:\n",
        "- **Hybrid search**: Combine vector similarity with keyword matching\n",

        "- **Multi-query**: Generate variations of user questions for better recall\n",
        "- **Conversational memory**: Add chat history for follow-up questions\n",
