This directory contains auto-generated files created during notebook execution. **These files should not be committed to version control.**

## Contents

### `chroma/`
**Vector database files** - Generated by ChromaDB when storing embeddings.
- Contains binary index files and SQLite database
- Automatically created when running notebooks 3-6
- Can be safely deleted and regenerated

### `youtube/`
**Downloaded media files** - Audio/video files downloaded from YouTube.
- Generated by `YoutubeAudioLoader` in notebook 1
- Large binary files (not suitable for git)
- Can be safely deleted and re-downloaded

## Regeneration

If you delete these directories, they will be regenerated automatically when you run the notebooks:

- **YouTube files**: Run notebook 1 with YouTube loader examples

## Note

These directories are ignored by `.gitignore` to prevent committing large binary files and auto-generated data.
